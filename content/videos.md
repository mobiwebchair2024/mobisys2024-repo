# Video Instructions

We request the authors of each accepted paper to record a teaser video no longer than 1.5 minutes. Teaser videos will be made publicly available on the ACM SIGMOBILE YouTube channel as soon as they are received, with the idea of garnering attention and interest a few weeks in advance of the main conference. We encourage you to come up with unconventional formats/new ideas/cool modalities for the teaser videos. Imagine your teaser video to be a commercial for your work, NOT a super-condensed paper presentation.

<br>

The teaser video should be uploaded no later than **June 13th**. The video file MUST meet the following requirements:

 - Landscape orientation 16:9
 - Resolution: 1280 x 720 (=16:9 ratio, 720p)
 - FPS: 30 frames / sec
 - In .MP4 format optimized for streaming
 - The Video Codec MUST be H.264
 - The Audio Codec MUST be AAC
 - Max file size: 500MB

Please check that the audio level IS NOT too low. You name your video files as

    $HOTCRP-PAPER-ID$_$LASTNAME-1ST-AUTHOR$_$PAPER-TITLE$-TEASER.mp4
    Example: 23_Davis_TheBestMobiSysSystemOfTheWorld-TEASER.mp4

All teaser videos must be accompanied by a signed release form. Authors who will create the video are requested to email Dong Ma at [dongma@smu.edu.sg](mailto:dongma@smu.edu.sg) to receive an audio/video release and consent form. The audio/video release and consent form, which gives ACM SIGMOBILE permission to host the produced video on YouTube, will be sent to the presenter using DocuSign. Once the signed consent is received, a link will be sent to the email address of the presenter to upload the teaser video.

If you have problems with uploading your recorded video or have questions, please feel free to reach out to Dong Ma at [dongma@smu.edu.sg](mailto:dongma@smu.edu.sg).
