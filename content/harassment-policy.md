## MobiSys Harassment Policy

The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of MobiSys; these require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. The ACM Code of Ethics embraces the “values of equality, tolerance, respect for others, and the principles of equal justice”. For these reasons, MobiSys is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience.

<br>

Harassment is unwelcome or hostile behavior, including speech that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation, in a MobiSys event. Harassment in any form, including but not limited to harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity, will not be tolerated. Harassment includes the use of gratuitous language or sexual imagery in public presentations and displays, degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

<br>

Conference participants violating these standards may be sanctioned, expelled from the conference or asked not to attend future conferences or conference events, at the discretion of the conference organizers and the SIG executive committee.

<br>

If you believe you have been harassed or notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you are encouraged to report the incident in confidence to either of [the conference chairs](org.html).
