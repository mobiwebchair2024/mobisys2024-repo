# Call for Papers
ACM MobiSys 2022 seeks to present innovative and significant research on all aspects of mobile computing, applications, and services. The conference values technical contributions with working implementations and practical evaluations. We also welcome work that explores new and compelling mobile scenarios and applications as long as the work goes well beyond providing an initial vision.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Experience with mobile applications, networks, and systems
* Applications of mobile sensing and crowdsourcing
* Tools for building and measuring mobile systems
* Innovative wearable systems and applications
* Software architectures for mobile devices and mobile computing
* Data management for mobile applications
* Infrastructure support for mobile computing
* System-level energy management for mobile devices
* Operating systems for mobile devices
* Support for mobile social networking and the mobile web
* Security and privacy in mobile systems
* Resource-efficient machine learning and AI for mobile devices
* Systems for location and context sensing and awareness
* Mobile computing support for pervasive computing
* Vehicular and mobile robotic systems
* Systems and networking support for virtual or augmented reality
* Applications of mobile systems in healthcare and accessibility
* Applications in sustainability and smart cities
* IoT systems and applications with their implications for mobile computing
* Novel mobile applications using machine learning
* Techniques and systems for novel human-mobile interactions and experiences
* Nano satellites and mobile computing in outer space
* Non-traditional topics that bring new perspectives to mobile computing

Papers whose contributions overlap with work currently under review elsewhere must not be submitted to ACM MobiSys. Papers whose contributions overlap with an earlier published paper will be considered only if (1) the previous paper was published (not just accepted) at a workshop at least 6 months before ACM MobiSys submission date and (2) it adds significant new contributions over the previous paper. Authors uncertain whether their submission meets these guidelines should contact the program chairs. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. Accepted submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

ACM MobiSys will use a double-blind review policy during the initial paper review. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper. Only PC chairs will know the identity of the authors and be able to interact with them during the review process, should the need arise. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed. Posted technical reports (ArXiv or similar) do not count as prior publication.

Submissions must be in PDF. We will not accept papers in any other format. Submissions must use a 10pt font (or larger) and be correctly formatted for printing on Letter-sized (8.5" by 11") paper. Paper text blocks must follow ACM guidelines: double-column, with each column 9.25" by 3.33", 0.33" space between columns and single-spaced. Submissions MUST be **no more than twelve (12) pages + unlimited number of pages for bibliography references.** The 12-page limit includes everything (e.g., abstract, text, appendix, etc.) except for the bibliography references. Submissions can use [this LaTex template](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2013/misc/sig-alternate-10pt.cls) that is known to comply with the formatting requirements. Authors remain responsible for checking that their resulting PDF meets our formatting and anonymity specifications. Submissions not following these guidelines will be rejected without review.

Submissions will be judged on originality, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and technical correctness. Papers may be conditionally accepted and shepherded by a member of the program committee, with final acceptance determined by consent of the shepherd.

As part of the submission process, authors of papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze nonpublic data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), will be asked to certify that their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects.

At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to register for the conference (at non-student rate) and present the paper in-person. The MobiSys organizers will monitor the pandemic situation in case accommodations are needed.

## Artifact Evaluation

Submissions may opt for an artifact evaluation. When authors do so, they commit to providing the implementations, models, test suites, benchmarks, and data used to derive the results presented in the paper to the artifact evaluation committee. Based on the evaluation, the papers will be awarded the appropriate artifact evaluation badge [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current). The artifact evaluation will be done after paper acceptance decisions.

**Selected outstanding papers may be fast-tracked as a special section of IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.**
