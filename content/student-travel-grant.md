# Student Travel Grant
ACM MobiSys 2022 is pleased to provide travel grants to support students attending the main conference and the co-located events. Grants are available only for full-time students attending colleges and universities in and outside the US. Priority will be given to students who will benefit from attending the main conference and its co-located events, but are unlikely to attend due to unavailability of travel funding. Please note that the travel grant is on a reimbursement basis. Furthermore, underrepresented minorities and women students are particularly encouraged to apply.
