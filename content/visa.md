# Visa Information

The [U.S. Department of State website](http://travel.state.gov/) has detailed information about obtaining a visa for those traveling to the United States with links to websites for U.S. embassies and consulates worldwide. The embassy and consulate websites have very helpful information about procedures, timelines, communities served, required documentation, and fees. International registrants should be particularly aware and careful about visa requirements, and should plan travel well in advance.

<br>

All visa inquiries must be handled by [ACM Headquarters](supportletters@acm.org).

## Support Letters

As part of the visa application process, you may be required to include a visa support letter. To request a visa support letter, register for the conference and then email your request to [ACM Headquarters](supportletters@acm.org), and include

- Your name as it appears on your passport
- Your current postal mailing address
- The name of the conference you wish to attend (“Mobisys 2024”)
- Your Registration Confirmation Number
- If you have any papers accepted for the conference, please provide the title and indicate whether you are the “sole author” or a “co-author”

Visa support letters are answered in the order they are received. You will receive a PDF letter by email within 4-5 business days. Please note ACM headquarters do not fax visa support letters. The PDF serves as a signed electronic version of the original letter which will be mailed to your current mailing address. If you do not receive the letter by post mail on time for your visa appointment, please print out your PDF letter and take it with you.

<br>

Please note that Support Letter will only be sent to participants who have registered and paid for the Conference. Should participants withdraw from the conference after the issue of Support Letter, the consulate will be notified of the withdrawal accordingly.

<br>

Please note that ACM does not issue formal letters of invitation to any of its conferences.
