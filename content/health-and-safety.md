# ACM MobiSys 2022 Health and Safety Policies

The organizers of ACM MobiSys 2022 continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic.

<br>

ACM MobiSys 2022 is planned as an in person event. We look forward to welcoming over 275 attendees in Portland, Oregon. As such, our top priority is the health and safety of all our attendees.

<br>

We will be following all Oregon Health Authority (OHA) guidelines for hosting large gathering events. We will be strictly adhering to the standards of our venue, The Nines to host the event.
You can view their [COVID-19 Information](https://www.thenines.com/covid-19/), as well as their [meetings and events roadmap](https://cdn.marriottnetwork.com/uploads/sites/12/2020/08/Marriott-Meetings-Events-RoadMap.pdf?x91183).

<br>

Masks are still strongly recommended in indoor public settings, to help reduce transmission and keep Oregon at a low risk level, but they are not mandated.

## Mask Policy

Oregon Health Authority strongly recommends that:
- All individuals that wish to wear a mask continue to do so.
- All people in Oregon support the right of other individuals to choose whether and when to wear a mask.
- Individuals continue to wear a mask when on public transportation, in ride-sharing services, on airplanes and in transportation hubs such as airports.
- Individuals review the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) (Community Levels)[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html] to understand the rate of COVID-19 transmission in their community.
- Individuals who live in communities with high transmission continue to wear a mask or face covering when in indoor public places, including in schools and other community settings.

## Prior to Departure

- Individuals who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 since June 13, 2022 are encouraged to get tested prior to departure.
- Individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 are asked to stay home and separate from others for 5 days. If you have no symptoms, or your symptoms are resolved after 5 days, you can attend the conference. Continue to wear a mask around others for 5 more days. 
- Continue monitoring your home country travel requirements to stay up to date and be prepared on the latest restrictions or travel requirements.

## How You Can Help Onsite

- Consider wearing a mask whenever you do not have a reason to be unmasked indoors, however, masks are not required. Vaccinated or not, wearing a mask in indoor public space can help protect you and everyone else close to you.
- Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
- Follow the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/travel-advice)’s (WHO) and [the U.S. Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/considerations-for-events-gatherings.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcommunity%2Flarge-events%2Fmass-gatherings-ready-for-covid-19.html) and Prevention’s (CDC) guidelines to prevent the spread of infectious diseases at the event.
- Sanitize your hands before and after physical greetings like handshakes, high fives, fist or elbow bumps, and hugs.
- Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
- Maintain social distancing between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
