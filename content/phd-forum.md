# MobiSys 2022 PhD Forum

MobiSys '22 is delighted to announce the PhD Forum. The goal of the PhD Forum is to provide a place where PhD students, particularly those in the midst of defining their dissertation research, can present their ideas to a supportive and constructive group. The PhD Forum will also facilitate networking among early career researchers in the community and showcase new up-and-coming talent.

<br>

Current PhD students are encouraged to submit a 2-page research summary describing their work in progress including a 100-word abstract. Though submissions from early-stage PhD students are particularly sought, PhD students at all stages of progress are welcome to submit a paper about work currently under development and potentially benefiting from community.

<br>

Things to consider for inclusion in the research summary might be: the expected contribution to the field; the original idea or thesis statement; the problem domain and the specific problem addressed; a brief overview of related work; the methodological approach; research carried out and results so far. The abstract should also include a one-paragraph biography of the student, including the names and affiliations of the research advisor(s), and the expected date of dissertation submission.

<br>

The PhD Forum committee will review submissions to ensure quality, relevance, and potential benefit from attendance. Accepted PhD Forum abstracts will be posted to the MobiSys '22 website. Authors of accepted submissions are expected to give an oral presentation of their paper during the PhD Forum event.
